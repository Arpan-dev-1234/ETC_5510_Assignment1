Individual Assignment
This assignment is designed to simulate a scenario in which you are taking over someone’s existing work and continuing with it to draw some further insights.

This is a real world dataset taken from the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. The data can be found here at https://www.bocsar.nsw.gov.au/Documents/Datasets/SuburbData.zip. Specifically, the data file called “SuburbData2019csv” located in your data folder inside the RStudio project will be used for this assignment.

You have just joined a consulting company as a data scientist. To give you some experience and guidance, you are performing a quick summary of the data while answering a number questions that the chief business analytics leader has. This is not a formal report, but rather something you are giving to your manager that describes the data with some interesting insights.

Please make sure you read the hints throughout the assignment to help guide you on the tasks.

The points allocated for each of the elements in the assignment are marked next to the code for each question.
